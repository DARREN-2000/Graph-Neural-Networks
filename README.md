# Graph-Neural-Networks
This code implements a sophisticated Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for predicting structural wear at mesh nodes. It combines multiple types of graph convolution operations and employs a message-passing paradigm to learn from the geometric, material, and loading properties represented as graphs.
